        <p>The Oxygen fonts are designed primarily for optimised
        functionality on various types and sizes of screens. The fonts
        are designed to be functional; spartan and uncluttered, but with
        enough stylistic detailing to add distinction at larger sizes.
        Part of the brief in designing the Oxygen Fonts is that they
        could also be used for print and web 'branding' of free
        desktops.</p>
        <p>The large x-height (above) ensures that text is clearly
        readable at standard desktop UI text sizes, even under lesser
        display options, or when viewed on small handheld devices. </p>

        <p class="lead-in">GNU/Linux Native</p>
        <p>The Fonts have been predominantly developed 'natively' on
        GNU+Linux systems, mainly using FontForge. This has allowed the
        fonts to be developed closely with Freetype's render and hinting
        engines, so that the fonts can be optimised with the pixel grid
        fitting on Freetype based OS's such as the various GNU+Linux
        systems, including Chrome OS and Android.</p>
