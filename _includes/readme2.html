        <p>The Oxygen fonts are designed to
        function well on various types and sizes of digital screens.

Free, functional, clean, uncluttered</div>
        The fonts
        are designed to be functional, clean, straightforward and uncluttered, but with
        enough stylistic detail to be distinctive at larger sizes.
        </p>
        <p>The fonts have a relatively large x-height that enables text to be clear and readable at standard desktop UI text sizes, even under lesser display options, or when viewed on small handheld devices. </p>

        <p class="lead-in"><img style="height:10px"src="assets/images/arrow.png"/>GNU/Linux Native</p>
        <p>The Oxygen Fonts have been developed 'natively' on
        GNU/Linux systems, mainly using FontForge. This has allowed the
        fonts to be developed closely with Freetype's render and hinting
        engines, so that the fonts can be optimised with the pixel grid
        fitting on Freetype based OS's such as the various GNU/Linux
        and similar systems, including Chrome OS and Android.</p>
