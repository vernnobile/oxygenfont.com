<p>Developing the Oxygen Fonts natively on a GNU+Linux system with FontForge has allowed the
fonts to be developed closely with Freetype's render and hinting
engines, so that the fonts can be optimised for the pixel grid
fitting on Freetype based OS's <i>(below)</i> such as the various GNU/Linux
and similar systems, including Chrome OS and Android.</p>
