        <p>The initial inspiration for the development of Oxygen Fonts was the idea of an integral font family for the Oxygen theme of the KDE desktop environment.</p>

            functional, clean, uncluttered...</div>
        
        <p>Taking it's cue from the Oxygen theme, the design for the Oxygen fonts aimed to make a font that was clean, practical and focussed, with a twist of elegance. The weight of the regular Oxygen font is slightly lighter than is generally found in UI fonts, to help achieve this look and feel.</p>
