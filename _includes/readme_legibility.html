    <p>The Oxygen fonts are designed to
    render well on various types and sizes of digital screens, from smart phone screens, to handheld tablets, netbooks, laptops, large desktop monitors, and television screens.
        The fonts
    are designed to be functional, clean, straightforward and uncluttered, but with
    enough stylistic detail to be distinctive at larger sizes.
