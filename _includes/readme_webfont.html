        <p>An early version of Oxygen Font was released as part of the Google Fonts project. </p>
         <p>Although released at an early stage of development with only 3 weights, the Oxygen webfont has proved to be a popular font for websites and framework theme designers. This early version of Oxygen Font is served by Google's Font API over 178,300,000 times a week.</p>
         <p>The feedback and stats produced by this level of usage has been an integral part of shaping the further development and refinement of the Oxygen Font family. Expanding the Oxygen Font family to eight weights, and further improving the rendering quality of the fonts, will make Oxygen Fonts an even more useful webfont family.</p>
